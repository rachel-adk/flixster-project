### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, they did help me. I used it to understand how to implement certian features and this helped me understand how to work on certain milestones. Implementing the sidebar(stretch feature) is something I initally felt unprepared to complete, but I was able to implement it in the end

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have worked more on the UI of my web app. But I think I like the functionality the way it is.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Implementing the core features went really well, because I was able to learn from my mistakes last week and work more efficiently and faster
